In 2017 a category-\/5 hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and wreaked havoc on the island\textquotesingle{}s infrastructure. Communication and power were disabled for an extended period of time causing lasting effects long after the hurricane passed. Many of these issues could have been prevented if civilians had access to a basic network where they could send short messages to emergency services and local governments.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_cluster_duck}{Cluster\+Duck}} Protocol was created by \href{https://www.project-owl.com/>}{\texttt{ Project O\+WL}} to be an easy to use mobile mesh network that can be accessed by people without the need to have specific hardware or pre-\/downloaded software (such as a mobile app). Since its creation, the vision for the \href{https://github.com/Code-and-Response/ClusterDuck-Protocol/wiki>}{\texttt{ Cluster\+Duck Protocol}} has grown beyond only servicing people in need after a hurricane towards additional use cases around earthquakes, wildfires, cellular congestion (large events), sensor networks, and more. \href{https://www.project-owl.com/>}{\texttt{ Project O\+WL}} open-\/sourced this project so that the \href{https://github.com/Code-and-Response/ClusterDuck-Protocol/wiki>}{\texttt{ Cluster\+Duck Protocol}} could reach the communities that need it as fast as possible and continue to explore new directions.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md70}{}\doxysubsection{How does it work?}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md70}
The network is made up of multiple nodes called $\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}\+Ducks\char`\"{}$\ast$$\ast$. There are 3 core roles in a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_cluster_duck}{Cluster\+Duck}} network\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_duck_link}{Duck\+Link}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mama_duck}{Mama\+Duck}}, and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_papa_duck}{Papa\+Duck}}. {\bfseries{Duck\+Links}} serve as edge nodes that only transmit data. These function as remote sensors or as additional access points to a Captive Portal. {\bfseries{Mama\+Ducks}} inherit the same functionality of the Duck\+Links, but also receive messages. Mama\+Ducks repeat messages from Duck\+Links and other Mama\+Ducks until the message reaches a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_papa_duck}{Papa\+Duck}}. {\bfseries{Papa\+Ducks}} are the endpoint of the network where all of the data is collected and can be stored or pushed up to the cloud. $\ast$$\ast$(free tier cloud D\+MS platform in B\+E\+T\+A!

The Captive Portal is an important feature in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_cluster_duck}{Cluster\+Duck}} Protocol network. The Captive Portal allows devices such as smartphones and laptops to access the network without the need to download additional software as it takes advantage a system that is native to smartphones such as Android and i\+Phone devices and laptops.

This is beneficial after events such as earthquakes or hurricanes where traditional communication infrastructure is crippled. Users are able to connect to the Wi\+Fi access point of a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_duck_link}{Duck\+Link}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mama_duck}{Mama\+Duck}} which will in turn relay their message onward.
