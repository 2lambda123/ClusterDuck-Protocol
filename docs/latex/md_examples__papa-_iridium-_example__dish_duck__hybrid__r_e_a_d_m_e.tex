Before the Dish\+Duck, the C\+DN operated where the Duck\+Links, Mama\+Ducks, and Papa\+Ducks communicate data with each other using Lo\+Ra. To get that data, the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_papa_duck}{Papa\+Duck}} has to be connected to the internet so it can push up the data for access. What happens when the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_papa_duck}{Papa\+Duck}} loses its connection to the internet? The Dish\+Duck. The Dish\+Duck is a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_papa_duck}{Papa\+Duck}} with an additional device attached to itself called the Rock\+Block 9603. The Rock\+Block acts like a modem for the Iridium Network which is a network of 66 satellites in the earthâ€™s orbit. So when the Dish\+Duck loses internet connection, it can use the Rock\+Block to transmit data to the satellite using Short-\/\+Burst Data. With the Dish\+Duck, combining the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_papa_duck}{Papa\+Duck}} and Rock\+Block, we can now retrieve our sensor data from anywhere in the world without relying on internet or G\+SM connectivity.\hypertarget{md_examples__papa-_iridium-_example__dish_duck__hybrid__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md52}{}\doxysection{Use Case Idea\+:}\label{md_examples__papa-_iridium-_example__dish_duck__hybrid__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md52}
The Dishduck was thought about after the recent earthquakes that have hit Puerto Rico. During these earthquakes, we realized that our sensors and ducklinks lost internet connectivity (backhaul) and could not send data back to the cloud. So we thought about what is a more reliable way to send data from our devices if we lose internet connection? So we thought about using the Iridium Network which has 75 satellites above in earth\textquotesingle{}s orbit. Allowing for almost a guaranteed connection anywhere anytime, as long as you have a view of the sky.\hypertarget{md_examples__papa-_iridium-_example__dish_duck__hybrid__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md53}{}\doxysection{Version 2.\+0 Hybrid Dish\+Duck}\label{md_examples__papa-_iridium-_example__dish_duck__hybrid__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md53}
We had to come up with a way in which we could make the Dish\+Duck smarter so it knows when it has connection to Wi\+Fi and can switch to the Rock\+Block Modem when Wi\+Fi goes down. That is what makes this version Hybrid vs Regular Dish\+Duck. It is a smarter way to go about things because you don\textquotesingle{}t want to always use up all your Rock\+Block airtime credits if you can send data over avaible Wi\+Fi connection.
